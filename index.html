      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Steve!</p>
      <p>I'm a 40 year old kid, with a passion for imagination. I have spent the last few years working with a niche bit of software called FileMaker.
        It's a very powerful tool, a mixture of database, front end, and back end all in one. The problem is that the skills I'd learned in my diplomas
        in Website Development and Software Development were falling by the wayside and I missed the nitty gritty of coding, giving me the scope to turn 
        my imagination into a thing! 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Bristol, in the UK, however I moved to Australia when I was around 30 or so. I've lived in Tassie, as well as Lane Cove in Sydney.</p>
      <p>I've also lived in Sao Paulo in Brasil, although my Portugese is now a little rusty....<em>Eu falo so pouqinho!</em></p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a huge Star Wars nerd, and love every aspect of it. My Favourite character is Grand Admiral Thrawn</p>

      </a>
      <p>I've a few other hobbies, but the main one would be collecting wine, I've a collection that has around 450+ bottles. I find it a fascinating world and love learning about the differences
        in the grapes, the regions, the techniques, and finding new treasures! The centrepiece of my collection is a bottle of 2008 Penfolds Grange.

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've been around long enough to know the perfect job is about the people you work with and the satisfaction you get from it. It's cheesy, I know!
        I very much enjoy providing solutions and making people happy with something I've created for them. I also enjoy investigating things, it's like a puzzle that needs to be solved!
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I now reside in Terrigal on the NSW Central Coast.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Delivering a product to a client, one they are happy with and is out there for the world to see, is rewarding!</p>
